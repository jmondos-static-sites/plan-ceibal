<h1>OLPC Technology</h1>
<p>The laptops that have been distributed for this program are called the "XO Laptop"</p>
<section>
  <h2>Hardware Technical Specifications</h2>
  <p>The design goals of the laptop's hardware were centered around its anticipated usage. The laptop needed to work in remote places without proper infrastructure by children primarily for <strong>low-demand usage, ebook reading, and child-gaming.</strong> </p>
  <p>Many of the features below were created specifically for the anticipated use of this laptop, namely remote places without proper infrastructure. The battery consumes very little power, about 10% of an average laptop. This is done by allowing the user to switch between black and white and color screen settings, among other options. Unfortunately, tests have shown that the battery itself holds the laptop back, only lasting 4-5 hours when it was originally quoted to last 10-12 hours. </p>
  <p>The laptop is very durable inside and out (it has no rotatable hard disks and is made of a strong plastic shell). It is about the size of a textbook and lighter than a lunchbox.</p>
  <p>The process was not created to be the fastest thing on the market. The primary demands of the laptops are not processor intensive. The flash drive (as opposed to a standard spinning disk hard drive) go a long way toward increasing speed of these types of tasks, along with adding to the durability of the machine.</p>
  <p>With all of these well-targeted features (other than the battery, perhaps), the final cost of these machines started at $185 for Uruguay in 2007, with the ultimate goal being to decrease costs to $100 over time. The list of hardware specifications below shows the manifestation of many of these design goals into the released XO laptop.</p>

  <h2>Software &amp; Content</h2>
  <p>The XO runs on a modified version of the Fedora operating system. The user interface is called Sugar (created and maintained by <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Welcome_to_the_Sugar_Labs_wiki">Sugar Labs</a> and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OLPC">Fedora-OLPC interest group</a>) and it runs software called child-friendly Activities. The Activities can be deployed from the Server or can be downloaded from the laptops themselves. In Uruguay, children who live in areas with Internet access are also free to browse the web on their laptops.</p>
  <p>Plan Ceibal uses their software distribution mechanism to help the teachers in adopting the new technology, as well as for helping kids downsize the negative effects of staring at computers. They created a math competition that had thousands of participants from each school competing to take home sponsor's prizes. They also created a vision test that was deployed to the laptops so that students could be made aware of any vision problems they may be developing, long before they would have been able to otherwise, given the resources of the country. Plan Ceibal also has plans to implement an App Store, similar to the one you would find on an Apple or Android smartphone so that outside developers can create applications for distribution on the device.</p>
  <p>While there are some teachers adding content to the Plan Ceibal network, they are also collecting information from outside sources such as <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, the latter of which has very similar goals to Plan Ceibal for content.</p>
  <p>The open-source developer community has a strong influence on what gets created for the device. For example, a student from Olin College, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/itdaniher">Ian Daniher</a> created a script that works with <a href="http://www.legoeducation.us/eng/product/lego_education_wedo_robotics_construction_set/2096">Lego WeDo Toolkit</a>, a robotics construction set for children. The script allows a user to read sensor data and control actuators, which helps kids understand and control communication with the WeDo. His project, called <a href="https://github.com/itdaniher/WeDoMore">WeDoMore</a> has been deployed to XOs in Uruguay.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>There are many levels of security in effect on the XO laptop.</p>
  <p>On first boot, a sequence happens where the student provides his picture and takes a picture of himself. This combination is used as the student's digital identity and is kept on file at the region's headquarters (in this case, Plan Ceibal).</p>
  <p>Each program does not have access to the file system of the computer to prevent Malware from attacking</p>
  <p>The computer "phones home" every day to a network server. If this request cannot be made, the computer shuts down after a certain number of days (specified by the country). If the computer is reported stolen and connects to the Internet, it performs a hard reset and must be reactivated, or it will not function at all. </p>
  <p>Lastly, they created a computer that looks very unique - everyone knows what it is, who it is for, and that it was stolen. Beyond this, every student has one, so there is no incentive to steal them from each other.</p>
  <p>Overall, Plan Ceibal reports that theft is not an issue in their implementation.</p>
