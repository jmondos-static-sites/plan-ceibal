<h1>Plan Ceibal History</h1>

<p>Plan Ceibal is Uruguay's implementation of the global One Laptop Per Child Program.</p>


<h2>One Laptop Per Child</h2>

<img src="img/OLPC_logo.png" width="135" height="156" alt="OLPC Logo" class="right">
<p>The One Laptop per Child Foundation (OLPCF) was founded by Nicholas Negroponte in 2005. The original goal was to oversee the creation of a computer that would be inexpensive enough to distribute to children in the developing world. It began in Cambridge, MA (Negroponte also founded MIT Media Lab) and now has offices in Kigali, Rwanda and Miami, Florida. </p>

<p>In its early days, the organization created a "Give One Get One" program to get people involved in the program. On November 12, 2007, the public was able to donate $399 and in return they would receive a OLPC laptop and donate one to a child in a third world country. This program was so popular they had to extend it from two weeks to the end of 2007. Approximately 83,500 orders were processed during this time.</p>

<p>A table of notable shipments is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child#Deployment_of_XO_laptops">available on Wikipedia</a>. According to the <a href="http://laptop.org/map">OLPC website</a>, 2.4 million teachers and children posses the <a href="/technology.html">xo laptops</a>. The first major order for these laptops was placed by Uruguay, through Plan Ceibal in December 2007. </p>

<h3>Comparison of Uruguay and Peru rollout</h3>
<p>The current leaders for quantity of laptops distributed are Peru and Uruguay. Uruguay has received 510,000 laptops to date and Peru has received 980,000. By percentage of students affected, Uruguay leads Peru significantly. Uruguay also completed rollout to its targeted students in two years.</p>

<h3>Government Support</h3>

<p>President Tabaré Vázquez announced that he would beat Argentina and Brazil in implementing the OLPC program. He planned that between March and September 2007, Uruguay would create a test program of 150 students. And that by 2009, the rollout would be complete. And they held that track. </p>


<h1>Results in Uruguay</h1>
<p>While the internet seems to be abuzz with praise and criticism for the OLPC program, the program has not been in effect long enough to be sure about its success. Uruguay, being the first country to rapidly deploy the program, does not have sufficient data on how students are learning with the laptops, because there hasn't been a group of students who have completed the new computer-based curriculum yet.</p>
<p>The program in Uruguay is going strong in terms of government support, distribution technique, repair needs, content provision, and application development, but the effect of all this remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>Support &amp; Criticism</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Implementation: <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/14558609">The Economist</a> reports that many of the computers came in the wrong language, students don't want to get their laptops fixed because it takes too long, most kids don't have internet at their schools, and that teachers don't embrace the technology. Published 2009.</li>
  <li>Technology: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/140931/first_look_olpcs_xo_laptop.html">PC World</a> writes that while the computer is sufficient for its task, it's nothing special, and sorely disappointing if you're expecting a modern PC.</li>
  <li>Learning: <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/09/one-laptop-per-child-study/">Mashable</a> reports that One Laptop Per Child doesn't increase test scores in math or language among Peruvian students, citing a study from the Inter-American Development Bank.</li>
  <li>Overall: <a href="http://cosnintltrips.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/uruguay-notes-holly-jobe/">Holly Jobe</a>, a visitor to Plan Ceibal, provided very positive feedback about what the group reported and what they saw in the elementary school that they visited. She also noted that Uruguayans are very proud to be pioneers in South American OLPC deployments.</li>
