<h2>One Laptop Per Child</h2>

<img src="img/OLPC_logo.png" width="135" height="156" alt="OLPC Logo" class="right">
<p>The One Laptop per Child Foundation (OLPCF) was founded by Nicholas Negroponte in 2005. The original goal was to oversee the creation of a computer that would be inexpensive enough to distribute to children in the developing world. It began in Cambridge, MA (Negroponte also founded MIT Media Lab) and now has offices in Kigali, Rwanda and Miami, Florida. </p>

<p>In its early days, the organization created a "Give One Get One" program to get people involved in the program. On November 12, 2007, the public was able to donate $399 and in return they would receive a OLPC laptop and donate one to a child in a third world country. This program was so popular they had to extend it from two weeks to the end of 2007. Approximately 83,500 orders were processed during this time.</p>

<p>A table of notable shipments is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child#Deployment_of_XO_laptops">available on Wikipedia</a>. According to the <a href="http://laptop.org/map">OLPC website</a>, 2.4 million teachers and children posses the <a href="/technology.html">xo laptops</a>. The first major order for these laptops was placed by Uruguay, through Plan Ceibal in December 2007. </p>

<h3>Comparison of Uruguay and Peru rollout</h3>
<p>The current leaders for quantity of laptops distributed are Peru and Uruguay. Uruguay has received 510,000 laptops to date and Peru has received 980,000. By percentage of students affected, Uruguay leads Peru significantly. Uruguay also completed rollout to its targeted students in two years.</p>

<h2>Government Support</h2>

<p>President Tabaré Vázquez announced that he would beat Argentina and Brazil in implementing the OLPC program. He planned that between March and September 2007, Uruguay would create a test program of 150 students. And that by 2009, the rollout would be complete. And they held that track. </p>
