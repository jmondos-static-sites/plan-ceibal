<h1>Results in Uruguay</h1>
<p>While the internet seems to be abuzz with praise and criticism for the OLPC program, the program has not been in effect long enough to be sure about its success. Uruguay, being the first country to rapidly deploy the program, does not have sufficient data on how students are learning with the laptops, because there hasn't been a group of students who have completed the new computer-based curriculum yet.</p>
<p>The program in Uruguay is going strong in terms of government support, distribution technique, repair needs, content provision, and application development, but the effect of all this remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>Support &amp; Criticism</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Implementation: <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/14558609">The Economist</a> reports that many of the computers came in the wrong language, students don't want to get their laptops fixed because it takes too long, most kids don't have internet at their schools, and that teachers don't embrace the technology. Published 2009.</li>
  <li>Technology: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/140931/first_look_olpcs_xo_laptop.html">PC World</a> writes that while the computer is sufficient for its task, it's nothing special, and sorely disappointing if you're expecting a modern PC.</li>
  <li>Learning: <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/09/one-laptop-per-child-study/">Mashable</a> reports that One Laptop Per Child doesn't increase test scores in math or language among Peruvian students, citing a study from the Inter-American Development Bank.</li>
  <li>Overall: <a href="http://cosnintltrips.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/uruguay-notes-holly-jobe/">Holly Jobe</a>, a visitor to Plan Ceibal, provided very positive feedback about what the group reported and what they saw in the elementary school that they visited. She also noted that Uruguayans are very proud to be pioneers in South American OLPC deployments.</li>
