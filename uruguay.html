<h1 id="country">The Country of Uruguay</h1>
<p>Uruguay has some unique features that contribute to its successes and failures in the distribution of laptops to every child. These features include dropout rates, small population, and the distribution of people in remote villages, some of which have no power.</p>

  <h2>Ninis</h2>
  <p>Deriving from the spanish "ni trabajar, ni estudiar" (neither work, nor study), <em>ninis</em> in Uruguay are a major problem for society. Only <a href="http://www.keyclub.org/service/fund/osp/unicef/opuruguay.aspx">one in three</a> students that start high school graduate and as <em>nini</em> suggests, many of them do not join the workforce. </p>

  <h2>Small Population</h2>
  <p>Compared to neighboring countries, Uruguay has a very small population. The entire country inhabits 3.2 million people, and there are 730,000 young people (age 0-14). Plan Ceibal targets about 395,000 of those children age 6-12. The small population allows them to attack this problem quickly and makes the goal of getting one laptop to every child much easier.</p>

  <h2>Scattered Population</h2>

  <p>The statistic that 92% of Uruguayans live in urban environments does not tell the whole story.</p>
  <p>Of the 3.5 million people that live in Uruguay, 1.5 million of them live in the city of Montevideo. The rest live in about 20 towns, spread out across the country's large land mass.</p>
  <p>Population density in Montevideo was recorded as 3,924 people/sq mi or 2,438 people/sq km in the <a href="http://www.geohive.com/cntry/uruguay.aspx">2011 census</a>. The density for the entire country (including Montevideo) is 48 people per sq/mi or 19 people per sq km, according to this data.</p>
  <p>While this demographic distribution would make it very easy to distribute laptops to 50% of Uruguayans, reaching 100% distribution is very difficult. Most of these remote towns and villages do not have internet, and many of them do not even have power.</p>

  <h2>Politics</h2>
  <p>Uruguay has a mix of free market and socialist policies that make it an interesting case study for OLPC implementation. Beyond policy, they also have a strong track record of continued support for projects, unlike for example, the neighboring country of Argentina.</p>

  <h3>Free Market &amp; Entrepreneurship</h3>
  <p>On the free market side, the country embraces Free Trade Zones like Zonamerica where businesses do not have to pay local government taxes. Interestingly, the zones are also owned and operated by private companies who industrialize an area and attract their tenant businesses to the space.</p>
  <p>There is a large contrast between Uruguay and its neighbor, Argentina. While the Argentine government is busy adding tarrifs, banning foreign currency exchange, and forcing every business to balance imports and exports to fix their trade deficit, Uruguayan government focuses on slower, sustainable growth and long term investment in their future with programs like Plan Ceibal.</p>
  <p>The country places a large emphasis on entrepreneurship and thanks to their small size and government stability, they can operate much of their government projects like a startup. For example, the country allows Plan Ceibal to operate as its own company, while funneling them their entire budget of $50 million per year. When asked whether they augment their funds with donations, Plan Ceibal reported that there is no need. They can rely on the government for this money. Support for Plan Ceibal continued during the regime change from President Tabaré Vázquez to President José Mujica in 2010, cementing the program as part of Uruguay's successes. </p>

  <h3>Socialist Policy</h3>
  <p>On the other hand, much of Uruguay's infrastructure is publicly owned. Republica AFAP (Pension Fund), AFE (Railways), ANCAP (Energy), ANCO (Mail), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (Telecommunications: Telephony, Mobiles (ANCEL and Data ANTELDATA)), BHU (Mortgage Bank), BROU (Bank), BSE (Insurance), OSE (Water &amp; Sewage), UTE (Electricity) are all publicly owned companies operating under Public Law.</p>
  <p>The one of most concern to Plan Ceibal is ANTEL, the public ISP of Uruguay. In the mobile space, they compete with Claro and Movistar. They have a monopoly over landline telephones, meaning they are the only company that can provide DSL Internet to homes in the country. </p>
  <p>This monopoly can help and hurt Plan Ceibal. If a partnership with Antel does not work, Ceibal's infrastructure is nonexistent. However, since Plan Ceibal is funded solely by the government, the two are encouraged to work together. But in typical entrepreneurial fashion, Ceibal explains it like this: Antel is looking for new customers, but they struggle with the economics of setting up internet to remote villages. We are a guaranteed customer, so they have sufficient incentive to help us build out connectivity to remote places. </p>
  <br />
  <p>Overall, the political situation seems to be helping Plan Ceibal achieve its goals of providing one laptop per child.</p>
